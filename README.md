Movie Recommendation System ReadMe:

Description: This project involves an advanced content-based movie recommendation system that utilizes cosine similarity. The system makes use of a dataset comprising over 5000+ movie reviews extracted from the TMDB Movies dataset available on Kaggle. NLP techniques with NLTK are applied for stemming and lemmatization, and sci-kit-learn's Count Vectorizer is used to convert text into numerical vectors using the bag-of-words approach. To enhance usability and provide a comfortable experience, a user interface is implemented using Streamlit. The system aims to offer personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie content analysis.
